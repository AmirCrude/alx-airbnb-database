# üè† Airbnb Database ERD Requirements

## **1. Project Overview**
This document defines the **entities**, **attributes**, and **relationships** for the **Airbnb Database Project**.  
The goal is to design a structured and normalized database model that supports users, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and messaging ‚Äî forming the foundation for an Airbnb-like web application.

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visually represents how these entities interact and ensures data consistency, integrity, and scalability in future development.

---

## **2. Objectives**
- Identify all entities and their key attributes.  
- Define clear relationships between entities (one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.).  
- Create an ERD using Draw.io or similar tools.  
- Provide a solid database foundation for further normalization and schema creation.
