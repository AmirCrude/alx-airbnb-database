## ðŸ§© Database Normalization

### Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
- All tables contain atomic values.
- Each table has a unique primary key (UUID).
- No repeating groups or multi-valued attributes.
âœ… All tables satisfy 1NF.

### Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Each table has a single-column primary key.
- No partial dependencies on composite keys.
âœ… All tables satisfy 2NF automatically.

### Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Verified that all non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.
- No transitive dependencies in any table.

## No need of Normalization
